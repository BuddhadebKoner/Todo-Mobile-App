# My First Expo Go App
This is my first app built using **Expo Go** and **React Native**. The app focuses on learning and exploring the fundamental features of mobile app development. With **Expo**, rapid prototyping and development have been simplified, allowing for a quicker setup process and real-time testing on both Android and iOS devices.

# Features
- **Cross-platform Support**: Runs on both iOS and Android.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and minimal UI.
- **Expo Integration**: Uses Expo for seamless development and testing.
- **React Native Basics**: Implements core concepts like components, navigation, and state management.
